# Testing Strategy for Visual Market Pulse Dashboard

## Overview

This document outlines the testing approach for the Visual Market Pulse Dashboard, ensuring reliability, performance, and adherence to the PRD's non-functional requirements (NFRs). Testing focuses on unit, integration, and manual end-to-end tests, given the MVP scope.

## Testing Types

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Focus:** Individual components, e.g., backend functions for data fetching and transformation.
- **Tools:** Python's unittest or pytest for backend; manual or simple scripts for frontend Alpine.js components.
- **Example:** Test `fetch_eod_data` function with mocked yfinance responses to verify data structure.

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Focus:** API endpoints and data flow between frontend and backend.
- **Tools:** Postman or curl for API testing; ensure caching works as expected.
- **Example:** Verify that the `/api/v1/nifty50` endpoint returns cached data on subsequent calls.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Focus:** User workflows, e.g., viewing the Nifty 50 heatmap.
- **Tools:** Manual testing via browser; automate with tools like Cypress if expanded beyond MVP.
- **Example:** Simulate user interactions to check if the dashboard loads EOD data correctly.

## Testing Guidelines
- **Coverage:** Aim for 80% code coverage on backend logic.
- **Edge Cases:** Test for invalid inputs, network failures, and data anomalies (e.g., missing Yahoo Finance data).
- **Performance:** Ensure API responses under 2 seconds (NFR-07), using tools like timeit in Python.
- **Frequency:** Run tests on every commit via local scripts or CI/CD on Render.

## Tools and Environment
- **Testing Tools:** pytest for backend, browser dev tools for frontend.
- **Environments:** Test in development locally and staging on Render.
