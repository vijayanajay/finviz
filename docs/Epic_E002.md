## 1. Epic Goal
*   Establish the core technical infrastructure and a responsive, accessible UI shell for the Visual Market Pulse Dashboard. This involves ensuring a consistent and reliable user experience across desktop and mobile devices, implementing essential non-functional requirements such as data handling (attribution, "as of" date, basic error states for system-level issues), and setting up the backend to efficiently serve the application and its data.

## 2. Business Value & Justification
*   This epic provides the critical foundation upon which all user-facing features, including the core heatmaps (Epic E001), are built. A stable, responsive, and usable application shell is paramount for user retention and overall satisfaction (PRD 1.1, 1.3). It directly supports our ability to achieve business goals like acquiring registered users (PRD Goal 1) and maintaining a good average session duration (PRD Goal 2) by ensuring the application is accessible, performs well, and is not frustrating to use. It also addresses key Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) that ensure the long-term maintainability, security, and reliability of the product. Without this solid groundwork, the visual features cannot be delivered effectively or professionally.

## 3. Scope & Features Covered
*   **In Scope Features (from PRD):**
    *   FEAT-010: Responsive Design (Alpine.js & Bootstrap)
    *   FEAT-002: Stock Tile Tooltip & Basic Info (EOD Data) (specifically the interaction mechanics like hover/tap for display, and dismissal of tooltips)
*   **Key User Stories (from PRD Section 6.2):**
    *   US2.1: As a developer, I need a Flask backend capable of serving the frontend application and providing efficient, cached API endpoints for EOD market and sector data from yfinance, so the frontend has reliable data.
    *   US2.2: As a developer, I need Alpine.js and Bootstrap 5 integrated into the frontend, so I can build a responsive, interactive UI with pre-styled components and lightweight reactivity.
    *   US2.3: As Priya, I want the dashboard to be easily viewable and fully functional on my desktop, tablet, and mobile phone, so I can check EOD market data conveniently wherever I am.
    *   US2.4: As Priya, I want all interactive elements (like sector selectors and stock tiles for tooltips) to be easy to click or tap, regardless of my device, so I don't get frustrated with usability issues.
    *   US2.5: As a user, I want to see data source attribution (e.g., "Data from Yahoo Finance") and a standard disclaimer (e.g., "EOD data, for informational purposes only") in the footer of the application, so I understand the data's origin and limitations.
    *   US2.6: As a user, I want the application to clearly indicate the "as of" date/time for the EOD data being displayed, so I know how current the information is.
    *   US2.7: As a developer, I need the application to implement basic security measures like HTTPS, CSP headers, and no exposed API keys, so user interactions are secure and the application is not vulnerable to common web attacks.
    *   US2.8: As a developer, I need basic monitoring and logging in place for the backend, so I can diagnose issues and ensure service availability.
*   **Out of Scope (for this Epic, clarify boundaries):**
    *   The specific rendering logic and data content of the heatmaps themselves (this is covered in Epic E001).
    *   Detailed data points within tooltips (data content is Epic E001; interaction mechanics are part of this Epic E002).
    *   Advanced Non-Functional Requirements beyond MVP needs (e.g., extensive scalability testing for millions of concurrent users).
    *   User accounts, authentication, or any personalized features (all Out of Scope for MVP).

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (High-Level for Epic)
*   The application shell loads correctly and is fully responsive, providing a good viewing and interaction experience across common desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.
*   Basic navigation and interaction elements (including sector selectors and tooltip invocation/dismissal) are easily usable and accessible on all supported devices and browsers.
*   The Flask backend successfully serves the frontend application files and provides functional API endpoints for data retrieval.
*   Server-side caching for EOD data is implemented in the backend and demonstrably improves performance/reduces external calls.
*   Essential information like data source attribution, disclaimers, and the "as of" data timestamp are clearly and persistently displayed in the application footer.
*   Basic security measures, including HTTPS for all communications and Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, are implemented.
*   The application adheres to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines for color contrast (text, UI elements) and keyboard navigation for key interactive elements like sector selection.
*   Tooltip interaction (display on hover/tap, easy dismissal) functions smoothly and intuitively on both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch) devices.

## 5. Dependencies
*   **Internal (Team/Technical):**
    *   Final decision on the hosting provider (Render has been confirmed - PRD 1.7).
    *   Setup of a basic CI/CD pipeline for streamlined deployment to Render (PRD Section 7).
    *   Availability of mock or sample EOD data to facilitate frontend development and testing of the application shell independently of live backend data (PRD Section 7).
*   **External (e.g., Data Sources, Other Teams):**
    *   D3 (PRD Section 10): Finalized specific text and any legal requirements for the Disclaimer and Data Source Attribution to be displayed in the application's footer (NFR-07). This requires PM input and sign-off.

## 6. Risks & Assumptions
*   **Key Risks (from PRD RAID Log, Section 10):**
    *   R5: Potential complexity in managing frontend state robustly with Alpine.js, even for foundational elements like loading indicators or global error messages, if not carefully architected.
    *   R6: Ensuring the responsive design (FEAT-010) is truly flawless and provides excellent clarity and usability across all target devices and viewports for the overall application, not just the heatmap areas.
*   **Key Assumptions (from PRD RAID Log, Section 10):**
    *   The chosen frontend stack (Alpine.js and Bootstrap 5) is sufficient to achieve the required level of responsiveness, interactivity, and accessibility for the MVP application shell.
    *   The Render platform provides all necessary capabilities and support for hosting the Flask backend (as a web service) and static frontend assets (as a static site) as envisioned in the architecture.

## 7. Success Metrics (How will we measure success for this Epic?)
*   Contributes to PRD Business Goal 1: Achieve 100 registered users within the first 6 months (a usable, accessible, and reliable application is a prerequisite).
*   Contributes to PRD Business Goal 2: Attain an average session duration of 2.5 minutes (a non-frustrating, performant, and responsive experience is key).
*   Adherence to NFR-01 (Performance): Application load times for the shell and basic interactions are met.
*   Adherence to NFR-03 (Compatibility): The application works correctly and consistently on all supported browsers and devices.
*   MVP Validation Feedback (PRD 3.3): Predominantly positive feedback from beta users regarding the overall ease of use, responsiveness, and intuitiveness of the application shell. High task completion rates for core user flows (which inherently rely on this foundational shell).
*   A low rate of UI/UX bugs related to responsiveness, basic interactions, or accessibility reported during the beta testing phase.

## 8. Technical Considerations (High-Level from PRD/Arch)
*   **Frontend Stack:** Alpine.js for client-side interactivity and state management for shell elements; Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout, grid system, and base styling (PRD Section 7, `architecture.md`).
*   **Backend Stack:** Flask (Python) for serving the frontend application and the necessary API endpoints (PRD Section 7, `architecture.md`).
*   **Data Handling (Shell Level):** Clear display of "as of" date for EOD data, data source attribution, and disclaimers. Robust error handling mechanisms for API communication issues, displayed user-friendly messages (NFR-07).
*   **Deployment Infrastructure:** Containerized deployment using Docker, with Gunicorn/uWSGI behind Nginx, hosted on Render. A basic CI/CD pipeline will be implemented (PRD Section 7, `architecture.md`).
*   **Security (NFR-06):** Implementation of HTTPS for all data transfer, appropriate Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, and ensuring no sensitive API keys are exposed in frontend code (PRD Section 7).
*   **Accessibility (NFR-02):** Conscious effort during development to adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines, particularly for color contrast and keyboard navigability of interactive elements.
*   **Testing Strategy (NFR-09):** Implementation of unit tests for critical backend logic (e.g., caching, API structure) and key Alpine.js component logic related to the shell. Basic automated end-to-end tests for core user flows and responsiveness checks.
*   **Maintainability (NFR-04):** Code should be well-commented, modular (e.g., Flask Blueprints, distinct Alpine.js components), and follow DRY principles.

## 9. Open Questions (Relevant to this Epic from PRD Section 12)
*   While most open questions in PRD Section 12 are tied directly to Epic E001 (heatmap specifics), ensuring that the foundational elements developed in this epic (like tooltip containers, error message display areas) are flexible enough to accommodate the eventual solutions to those questions is an implicit consideration here.
*   The specific details and configuration of the CI/CD pipeline setup for deployment to Render need to be finalized.

## 10. Notes & Future Considerations
*   This epic is crucial for establishing the overall quality, reliability, and professionalism of the application. A poor foundational experience can undermine even the best features.
*   Future considerations might include evolving the global state management approach if application complexity grows significantly, or developing a more comprehensive design system beyond Bootstrap's defaults.
*   Thorough implementation and verification of the testing strategy (NFR-09), especially for responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility of the shell, are key to this epic's success.
