      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Project Setup with Flask, Bootstrap, and HTMX",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Flask project setup task into subtasks covering: 1) Project structure and virtual environment setup, 2) Base template creation with Bootstrap and HTMX integration, 3) Basic route implementation and configuration, and 4) CSS setup with styling variables.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up the project foundation with multiple technologies (Flask, Bootstrap, HTMX). While each component is relatively straightforward, the integration requires careful attention to ensure all parts work together. The task includes file structure creation, dependency management, template setup, and basic configuration - making it moderate complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Backend API Integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the backend API integration task into subtasks covering: 1) API client implementation for different data endpoints, 2) Data processing utilities for formatting API responses, 3) Caching implementation for performance optimization, 4) Error handling for API failures, and 5) Integration with Flask routes.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a service layer to interact with external APIs, handling multiple endpoints, implementing caching, error handling, and data processing. The complexity comes from ensuring robust error handling, implementing proper caching strategies, and creating reusable data processing functions that will be used throughout the application."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Homepage Market Heatmap (FEAT-001)",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the market heatmap implementation into subtasks covering: 1) CSS grid layout for the heatmap, 2) Dynamic tile generation with color coding based on stock performance, 3) Responsive design for different screen sizes, 4) Interactive elements (click and hover behaviors), and 5) Integration with the backend data service.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a complex visual component with dynamic data representation, color coding, and interactive elements. The heatmap requires careful CSS implementation, responsive design considerations, and integration with backend data. The interactive elements add another layer of complexity with event handling for different devices."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Stock Tile Tooltip with HTMX (FEAT-002)",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the stock tooltip implementation into subtasks covering: 1) HTMX route and partial template for tooltip content, 2) Tooltip positioning and styling, 3) Device-specific interaction handling (mouse vs touch), and 4) Performance optimization for rapid hover movements.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing dynamic tooltips using HTMX, which adds complexity through asynchronous content loading. The tooltip functionality needs to work across different devices (mouse hover on desktop, tap-hold on mobile), and requires careful positioning and styling. Performance considerations for rapid hover movements add another layer of complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Stock Detail Page (FEAT-003)",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the stock detail page implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Template creation with responsive layout, 2) Stock information display with proper formatting, 3) D3.js chart implementation for price data, 4) Timeframe selection UI components, 5) Integration with backend API for stock details, and 6) Error and loading state handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a complex page with multiple components including a D3.js chart, which is inherently complex. The implementation requires data fetching, processing, and visualization, along with responsive design considerations. The chart implementation alone is quite complex, requiring knowledge of D3.js for data visualization."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Chart Timeframe Selection (FEAT-005)",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the chart timeframe selection implementation into subtasks covering: 1) UI component for timeframe buttons, 2) API endpoint for fetching timeframe-specific data, 3) Chart update logic when timeframe changes, and 4) Loading and error states for timeframe transitions.",
      "reasoning": "This task builds on the stock detail page to add timeframe selection functionality. While it's not starting from scratch, it requires creating a new API endpoint, implementing UI controls, and handling the chart updates. The complexity is moderate as it involves both frontend and backend changes, but is focused on a specific feature."

    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Consistent Color Coding System (FEAT-011)",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the color coding system implementation into subtasks covering: 1) CSS variable definition for the color scale, 2) Utility functions for determining colors based on percentage changes, and 3) Color legend component creation for user reference.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a consistent color system throughout the application. While important for visual consistency, it's relatively straightforward, involving CSS variable definitions and utility functions. The color legend component adds some complexity but is primarily a static display element."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Responsive Design with Bootstrap (FEAT-010)",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the responsive design implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Base template updates with responsive navigation, 2) Responsive grid implementation for the heatmap, 3) Media queries and responsive adjustments for different screen sizes, and 4) Touch interaction optimization for mobile devices.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires ensuring the entire application is responsive across different devices. It involves updating multiple templates, implementing responsive grids, and adding media queries for different screen sizes. The complexity comes from ensuring consistent behavior across various viewport sizes and optimizing for both mouse and touch interactions."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Minimalist Navigation (FEAT-012)",

      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the navigation implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Navbar implementation with responsive behavior, 2) Breadcrumb navigation for detail pages, and 3) Back button functionality with proper history management.",
      "reasoning": "This task focuses on implementing a simple navigation system with browser back button support. It's relatively straightforward, involving standard navigation patterns like navbar and breadcrumbs. The complexity is low as it primarily uses Bootstrap components and simple JavaScript for history management."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the error handling and loading states implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Reusable loading component creation, 2) Error message components with different severity levels, 3) Integration of error handling in Flask routes, and 4) AJAX loading indicators with HTMX.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a consistent system for error handling and loading states throughout the application. It requires creating reusable components, implementing error handling in multiple routes, and adding AJAX loading indicators. The complexity is moderate as it touches multiple parts of the application and requires careful error management."
